Web-based LAN Seeker
==============

Combines LAN Seeker and Game Installer into a flexible web interface
--------------

The initial goal of the LAN Seeker was to offer a stand-alone tool aiming to be as lightweight as possible.
With increasing demand of complex features, it grew into a more rigid framework and eventually ran into implementation contraints.
While the previous LAN Seeker and Game Installer were two destinct tools mostly working individually from different machnines, the LAN Seeker now combines and centralizes them into one web interfaces. By keeping the code and distribution on one machine, the tool stays flexible and up-to-date without any client downloads or compatibility issues. With access to one network node only, the distribution of software can be administrated more efficiently.
A web-based interface is even more lightweight than the initial version, though adding a lot more features. The greatest of which is its flexibility.
